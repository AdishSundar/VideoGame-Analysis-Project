# VideoGame-Analysis-Project
Determines important characteristics of highly rated video games, uses nltk to create a sentiment analysis score based off of video game reviews, and utilizes machine learning through sklearn to create a genre classification model.

As someone who loves video games, in this project, I wanted to explore what were characterstics of video games that led to higher rankings.
After all, what makes a video game good is incredibly subjective. I viewed change in trends over 40+ years of time across the video game industry, looked at coorelation matrices between many variables including a sentiment analysis score based on the reviews that people left for each game, and lastly created a genre classification model after testing the accuracy of 4 different machine learning models known to
perform well with classification based on the numerical features I engineered.
